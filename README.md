#### When it's time for students to schedule their classes for the next semester, everyone must refer to the LSU course booklet. However, the current booklet is hard to understand due to its cluttered layout and  information in one place. The current searching process can be overwhelming or stressful for students. New students are unfamiliar with the layout of the course booklet, and upperclassmen are frustrated as they must keep track of their required classes. Our goal for this project was to create a more aesthetically pleasing user interface to make the course booklet easier to interpret and incorporate an advanced search bar for finer search details like the day, time of day, virtual, etc. 

### Features:
- #### An advanced search bar to ensure that students will have more control over what classes they see while searching through the course offering page (i.e. virtual flag, CxC flag, time of day (morning/afternoon/night), day of the week)
- #### A more organized and aesthetically pleasing interface (i.e. alternating line colors, dark/light mode based on system settings, separation of class by level (1000+, 2000+, etc.), more detailed description for column abbreviations)
- #### A scheduling resource page including information on various colleges' advisors/flowcharts, general catalog, and other resources relevant to the scheduling process
- #### A schedule planner allowing the user to experiment with a potential schedule that will not affect their actual schedule registration in myLSU

### Technologies utilized to create application:
- #### Extensible Markup Language (XML)
- #### Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
- #### Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
- #### NodeJS
